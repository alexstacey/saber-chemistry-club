![First Thursday of the month](/cc_header.png)

Chemistry Club is a monthly Thursday night party in Kreuzberg which gives DJs the chance to step outside of the styles they play in house-and-techno clubs and share the lesser-heard gems in their collections. The night is hosted by resident bad_dubs alongside a different guest DJ each month. Expect to hear a diverse selection of living room jams, world beats, underground pop, and back-to-mine anthems. Afterparty vibes on a Thursday night.
