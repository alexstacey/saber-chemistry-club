Don't call it a comeback! We've been here for years...  
Something that hasn't happened for a while though is the Skrufix DJ posse all behind one set of decks. As a send-off to Ralphalfa, who's set to depart Berlin soon, we decided a reunion was in order. So we've got Shanghai Burton, The Crane, Skwirl, Ralphalfa and Things With Wings together for a night of freestyle music, happiness and care-free shape-cutting. Hold tight - things just got re@l.

8 til late. Free entry.
