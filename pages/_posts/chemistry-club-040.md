Don't read the news today. Spoiler: it's all meh. Get through your work-day. Do your stuff. Then browse to twitch.tv/ChemistryClub where we'll be starting the weekend in the best possible way, with good music, friendly vibes and smiling faces. Chemistry Club host bad_dubs is welcoming two special DJs to serve up the tasty tunes:  
Low End Activist - releasing on the incredible Sneaker Social Club label that's been at the forefront of the rave-revival - and Shanghai Burton, from the amazing Big In Japan label, who have been supplying us with a fix of "Latin chug" when we need it most.

When: 6pm-10pm. Live business. Miss it = miss out.  
Where: twitch.tv/ChemistryClub  
Physically distanced; socially together.
