Chemistry Club is back on a Thursday in April - and the next day is a public holiday. Start your Easter weekend in style and come join the party.

In an exciting first, we'll have a live band (complete with drum-kit and guitars) kicking things off at 9pm.
For those that know, this is a rare opportunity to see COMA_54 in re@l life. For those that don't - [check em out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57ritvTNRxQ).  

After the band, resident bad_dubs will be joined behind the decks by special guest DJ OK Jones from [Love Glove](https://www.facebook.com/LoveGloveDisco).
As always, expect a diverse selection of living room jams, world beats, underground pop, and back-to-mine anthems - but this time starting with live rock!

8pm til late. €2 entry!
