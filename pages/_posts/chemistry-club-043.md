Everyone's favourite Thursday night music and social club is back!

Chemistry Club returns to the Dorf on 4th November with a new start time of 6pm. Come straight from work, have a dance and a chat, and still get to bed at a reasonable hour. Or stay for the duration and have a duvet day on Friday. It's your choice! What a time to be alive.
