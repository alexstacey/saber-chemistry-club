Join us on Thursday 1st December for the second edition of Chemistry Club. This month, alongside Things with Wings, we have very special guest DJ Bill Robin (Rebel HiFi / Dub War / South London HiFi).
This is not a house-and-techno party. Expect to hear a diverse selection of living room anthems, world beats, underground pop, and back-to-mine jams
