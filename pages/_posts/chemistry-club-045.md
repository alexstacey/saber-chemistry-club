The first Chemistry Club of the year is a Saturday special!

Resident DJ bad_dubs is joined by none other than Appleblim, alongside a guest set from Jonny No Dreds. The trio will be spinning freestyle grooves, living room jams, world beats, underground pop, and back-to-mine anthems.

9pm til late. Free entry!

This is a 2G+ event, so make sure you bring a same-day negative test result if you're not boosted.
