Oh gosh! We're hyped to have Limo D in the house for February.  
Following his appearance at the December all-stars party, where we witnessed a DJ clearly at the top of his game, Limo D is back with a big spoonful of sonic medicine to heal your soul.  
Chemistry Club is known for its freestyle music policy and friendly vibes. Expect to hear a wide range of musical styles that will lift you out of the seasonal greyness and transport you to a brighter place.  

8pm til late. Free entry.
