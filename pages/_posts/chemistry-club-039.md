Who knew the 39th edition of Chemistry Club would be happening over the interweb? Well, it is... And it's going to be about as much fun as can be had via a medium of 1s and 0s. We've got a bunch of DJs lined up, including:

### DJs
- 2ubox
- bad_dubs
- Dani Jacques
- Dj Le Pot Belge
- Haider
- Limo D
- Lovegun
- Ralph Alpha
- Skwirl
- Surly Tempo
- The Crane

We've even got a VR club for those of us that are missing our wonderful Neuk√∂lln home of the Dorf.
So get some drinks in, get your dancing slippers on, and join us here (no special software required - let your browser take the strain):
