It's almost December - which can only mean one thing! It's time for the Chemistry Club Christmas Special! For this festive edition, resident Things With Wings will be joined by... LOTS OF PEOPLE: A selection of DJs who've already graced the Dorf decks, as well as a lineup of special guests, will play their favourite freestyle tunes for half-hour each from 8 am until the wee hours.

Join us for music, friendship, laughter and love - and let's celebrate the season together.
