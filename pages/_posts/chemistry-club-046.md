March's Chemistry Club is happening on a Monday - because the next day is a public holiday! We're celebrating Women's Day in style with special guests Alma Alloro and Forever Sound accompanying resident bad_dubs behind the decks.

As always, expect a diverse selection of living room jams, world beats, underground pop, and back-to-mine anthems.
8pm til late. Free entry!

This is a 2G+ event, so make sure you bring a same-day negative test result if you're not boosted.
